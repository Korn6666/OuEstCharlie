Rules: 
Find Charlie and click on him!! 

This game is founded on Conwayâ€™s Game of Life : https://playgameoflife.com
It's a cellular automaton rules by 2 rules:
- Any live cell survives with 2 or 3 live neighbours. Otherwise she dies. 
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell

Charlie is a square of 4 cells that don't respect these rules. 
Charlie survive and stay at his place no matter what! Find him!


PS: Be careful because a square of 4 cells is a still lifes patern,
meaning that it remains alive with dead neighbours.
